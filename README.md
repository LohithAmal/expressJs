# EXPRESS JS

* This module will explain how to create your own server side API using EXPRESS J.S framework.
* EXPRESS allow quick and easy API route & associated HTTP request methods.
* Routing is how we handle server response whenc client makes a request.

## Brief about SERVER

*  A server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".

# zoo keepr
* this module will create a web server using Express.js and add it to the front end that a local zoo developing
* we will deploy this site to HEROKU-a clound application platform that allow you to deploy application with servers to a webpage.

## project Brief
### our local zoo is moving to the cloud. They want to move there filing cabinet data to cloud digital information management. This allow Zoo managemnt to work more effectively and also allow educational details to public online.

## To Do List for the ZOO kepr

* create front end: HTML and CSS
* create a data base
* create back end: handle data management

## tools needed
* Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is considered the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

* Insomnia Core is a powerful REST API client that allows us to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser.

* Heroku https://www.heroku.com/  is a cloud application platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Unlike GitHub pages, which only allows you to deploy static sites with HTML pages, Heroku allows you to deploy a server.js file that will run the Node.js process. Youâ€™ll also use the Heroku CLI https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli, which will help you deploy apps easily without leaving the command line.

## lesson objective
 ### By this project we will learn how to do the followings,
 * setup and run a Node.js web server using Express.js
 * handle two types of GET request using parameters
 * make the application production-ready and deploy it on Heroku.
